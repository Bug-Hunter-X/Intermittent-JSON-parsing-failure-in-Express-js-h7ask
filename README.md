# Intermittent JSON Parsing Failure in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a bug where an Express.js application intermittently fails to parse JSON request bodies. The issue is characterized by `req.body` being undefined in the request handler, without any apparent errors in the server logs. This behavior appears random and lacks consistent reproducibility.

## Bug Description

The application uses `express.json()` middleware to parse JSON request bodies. However, under certain conditions (unclear at the moment), the middleware fails to parse the request body, leading to `req.body` being undefined in the request handler. This results in unexpected behavior or errors in the application logic.

## Reproduction Steps

Reproducing the bug is challenging due to its intermittent nature. It may involve a combination of factors such as request rate, network conditions, or server load.   

## Solution

A robust solution involves configuring `express.json()` with explicit size limits to handle potentially large requests and implementing error handling to detect and manage parsing failures gracefully.
